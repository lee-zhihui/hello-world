I have never used Isomer before. Understand from my husband that it looks easy. He just sent me the URL to the Isomer training materials via Whatsapp at 4.50pm. 

What I did today: Met my cousin-in-law from my husband's Tang family side. Attended the same Hatha class today. I told her how boring my current life is now - partly due to the Wuhan coronavirus. I have been receiving so many WhatsApp messages on updates of the virus over the past few weeks. 

She told me about the Gov.sg WhatsApp Subscription, which I had subsequently signed up for, that provides the latest information about the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), Factually (clarifications about Govt-related fake news), important Government updates, and Merdeka Generation Package (MGP)!
